So I really ought to enter Protected Mode, I think.

Real mode is actually a 16-bit mode. It hasn't been current since the.. 286? 386? A long time, anyway.

In Real mode:
  - I have less than 1 MB of RAM.
  - No hardware memory protection
  - lots of other things. Let's move to how to.


But first, I'm getting kind of frustrated with the loop. I'm not sure what to do. I start reading about Protected Mode
and then the docs all talk about how things were done on th 386, so I start looking at the AMD programmer's manual,
which makes it certainly clear that the best thing to do is go for 64 bit mode, but then I don't have a 64-bit compiler...
Sigh....

Obviously, for the purposes of cool, functional code, it would be best to make my OS 64 bits. However, seeing as I'll be
lucky to mount a file system at this rate, it might be good to just proceed with the 32 bit architecture and take
comfort in the docs that are available to me. I'll probably end up not doing system programming on an amd64 machine
anyway. #TheAgeOfARMIsUponUs
