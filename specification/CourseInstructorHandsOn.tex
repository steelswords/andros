As a course instructor I need equipment in the control systems lab that provides students with a useful hands-on experience.
\bigskip
  
In order to be useful the lab equipment used must not be mysterious (or overly 'black box').
\bigskip
  
Students need to see the inputs and outputs of the system and understand that they can replicate similar systems in their careers.
\bigskip
		
The power amplifier module must be constructed of a technology that is familiar to both mechanical and electrical/computer engineering students at a late-junior year level.  In order to meet this familiarity requirement the design is constrained to use a power operational amplifier.
\bigskip
		
The power amplifier needs to be a unity voltage gain non-inverting buffer. 
\bigskip

The power amplifier must provide a minimum continuous output current of 8 amps.
\bigskip

The input impedance of the power amplifier must be greater than or equal to 10 kilohms.
\bigskip
		
The largest time constant of the power amplifier must be less than 0.001 seconds.
