As a student, I want my instructors to be aware that I am busy and that this course is not the only one that I have.  Labs that require long or complex setups are 
seldom worth my time.  I want a setup that I learn from and that increases my understanding of what I am studying.  \hilite{red}{Color coding helps me avoid wiring errors and speeds the setup.}
