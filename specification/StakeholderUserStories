As a course instructor I need equipment in the control systems lab that provides students with a useful hands-on experience.
\bigskip
  
The project must require 400 hours of technical effort. Any more than that, and the task becomes too onerous for a two-credit class. Much less and the student has not gained the experience I hoped they would in the senior design process.
\bigskip

The project must be safe.
As a faculty member, I do not want to be responsible for damage to life, limb, property, or data.
\bigskip

The project must be somewhat interesting.
