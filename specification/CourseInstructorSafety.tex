As the course instructor, I need a safe module for the students to use.   Safety implies freedom from both electrical and mechanical hazards.
\bigskip
		
The module must be free of sharp edges.
\bigskip
		
The module must not present a dangerous shocking hazard to students.
\bigskip

In order to eliminate a potential dangerous shocking hazard the power amplifier module supply voltages are constrained to: $V_{+} \leq 18 \: \text{volts} \: \text{and} \: V_{-} \geq -18 \: \text{volts}$ or a total supply swing of $\leq 36$ Volts.
