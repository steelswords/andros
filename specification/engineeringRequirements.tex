\section{ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS}

\begin{slshape} 
\color{blue}
	This section constitutes the meat of the document. Remember that it is ''requirements" and not methods. The 
	definition here should leave no doubt about what is needed.  Engineering requirements differ from stakeholder requirements in measurability, detail, and unambiguity.
	\bigskip
	
	Measurability is a key attribute; without it we have no way of knowing that we have built what we said that we would build.  In the aerospace industry 
	the process of determining that what we have built meets the plan to which we were building is called verification.  Verification answers the question,
	``Did we build what we said we would build?"
	\bigskip
	
	Ideally, detail in engineering requirements means that the designer can set off designing and building the system with little or no extra input from the stakeholders.  
	Since we do not live in an ideal world additional stakeholder input will be required.  When additional input is sought the specification should be revised to reflect clarification
	or change.  Reality is why we include a Revision History Block at the beginning of the specification.
	\bigskip
	
	An ambiguous requirement, by its very nature, means that I could design and build the system in one, two, or many `wrong' ways.  Since the stakeholder who is paying for this system doesn't want one of the many possible wrong ways we need to ensure that requirements cannot be misinterpreted by the designer. 
 \bigskip
	
	
	
	Understand:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ``An engineering requirement is a statement about the system that is unambiguous. There's only one way it can be interpreted, 
							and the idea is expressed clearly so all of the stakeholders understand it."
			\item ``An engineering requirement is binding. The customer is willing to pay for it, and will not accept the system without it."
			\item	``An engineering requirement is testable. It's possible to show that the system either does or does not comply with the statement." (Steve Tockey)
		\end{enumerate}
		
Additionally, requirements must be stated in one place only in this document.  You can reference the requirement in another part of the document by using its paragraph number.  It is often tempting to restate a requirement in another requirement to improve clarity.  However, a requirement stated in two places may only get changed in one place during a revision and possibly  leading to confusion or worse a flawed product.
\bigskip
		
Engineering requirements constitute contacts between between clients and design teams.  Requirements are binding.
\bigskip		
		
Requirements form the base that we design on.  A well written requirement keeps us from ending up with a less than ideal implementation.  
Defining requirements forces us to think prior to design.
\bigskip
		
The engineer's job at this point is to make the stakeholder requirements of the previous section into measurable, detailed, and unambiguous.  
Sometimes this process requires that a stakeholder be interviewed again until a proper set of engineering requirements emerge.
\bigskip 

An old joke in aerospace says that a specification is written and thrown over a high wall to the design group.  The spec. writer then runs away from the wall (laughing).  While formal adoption of this absurd method leads to disaster, we should write specifications as if we could never clarify anything.  The clearer we make the specification now, the lower the cost of change later.
\bigskip



\subsection*{\underline{Processing Stakeholder Requirements into Engineering Requirements}}

Stakeholder requirements in the form of user stories are typically poorly organized and indefinite.  A designer cannot design to an indefinite requirement.  How would a designer know if an indefinite requirement was met?  Also, different stakeholders may have requirements that effect overlapping areas of the system but because of the nature of story collection the overlap in these requirements may not be obvious.  There are many more issues and a systematic approach to this processing problem should help. 
\bigskip

The work of sorting and firming up requirements can be considered tedious.  Engineers are famous for hating tedious work.  It is why we are constantly automating things that we don't want to do.  And when we encounter a tedious task we have a tendency to create a process to limit the amount of tedium that we must endure.  Tedious work reduced to a process becomes less tedious if the process is well designed.  In order to translate the scattered and indefinite stakeholder requirement into organized and definite engineering requirements we are going to follow a two step process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify and sort stakeholder requirements into fixed categories.
\item Rewrite the sorted requirements into definitive engineering requirements.
\end{enumerate}

The details of the process are explained in the following sections.

\subsubsection*{\underline{Identifying and Sorting the Stakeholder Requirements}}

At this point in the process we are faced with the task of identifying and sorting the requirements found in the user stories.  Finding the requirements is pretty easy.  The user wants us to do something and that something is a requirement.  Sorting the requirements is only slightly more difficult because we need bins for the different categories of requirements.  Different companies come up with different bins so I don't feel too bad at coming up with my own set of bins.
\bigskip



It helps me to think of the process of translating stakeholder user stories into engineering requirements as a machine with several stages.  We take the often less than definite requirements that we find in user stories, clarify the untranslatable stuff, and sort the results into applicable categories.  The first stage of the process is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PreliminarySorting}.
\bigskip

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=15cm]{PreliminarySorting.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:PreliminarySorting} A machine that sorts user stories into appropriate categories.}
\end{figure}



\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	We will be sorting the requirements into four categories:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Untranslatable Stuff
		\item Interface Stuff
		\item Functional Stuff
		\item Non-Functional (Support) Stuff
	\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\bigskip

%These categories shown in the illustration are:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \colorbox{Goldenrod}{Interface Constraints}
%\item \colorbox{Lavender}{Method Constraints}
%\item \colorbox{red}{Functional Requirements}
%\item \colorbox{green}{Non-Functional Requirements (better called Functional Support Requirements)}
%\item \colorbox{YellowOrange}{Options}
%\item (Fluff)
%\end{enumerate}
%
%The colors shown in the above list will be used to highlight pieces of the example stakeholder user stories that correspond to the categories.
%\bigskip

The categories themselves are intended to cover all aspects of the project in a systematic and an understandable fashion.  Properly chosen categories allow the designer working from this specification to verbally see the system (don't worry, we will also draw a few actual pictures of the system).  I'll explain the categories in the next sections.

\paragraph*{Untranslatable Stuff}

Let's face it we're human and our project stakeholders are human.  Being human we don't always communicate what is either meaningful or useful.  Sometimes, as engineers, when we hear or read a stakeholder statement it may seem vague or more like a wish.  Sometimes the statement may be incredibly obvious, but hard to translate into a measurable requirement.  When we encounter such statements it is up to us to approach the individual stakeholder and ask (politely) what on earth the statement means in terms of the project deliverables.
\bigskip  

Interacting with our stakeholders early in a project is a good thing.  We establish the lines of communication that we will most definitely need sometime in the project.
\bigskip

\paragraph*{Interface Stuff}

We design and build things to perform some useful or interesting function.  Interesting things interact or interface with their environment to send information, provide motive power, receive and process information, receive power, fit into an existing slot, etc.  Interfaces make up the useful pieces of a system and are critical to the system.
\bigskip

The documentation for many complex systems includes a very useful document called an Interface Control Document, or ICD for short.  This document contains all the interface information for the system.  It is a very useful document and helps designers avoid a host of errors.  If such a document is available when the specification document is being written then it is simply referenced in the Applicable Documents Section of the specification.  For our purposes we will define the interface requirements as part of this specification document.
\bigskip

\paragraph*{Functional Stuff}

The devices we make are intended to do something.  The something that they are supposed to do is defined as functional constraints (designer's hands tied) and functional requirements (designer is free to choose the method).
\bigskip


\paragraph*{Non-Functional (Support) Stuff}

The engineered system is designed to produce certain things and interface in certain ways.  To accomplish its function the system needs a lot of support.  For example, a system is designed to process input data in a specific digital format and output the processed data in a specific digital format.  The format constitute interface constraints, but the connector for the digital formats constitute non-functional or functional support interface constraints.
\bigskip

The box that keeps the system from getting wet constitutes a non-functional or functional support requirement while the data processing requirements constitute a functional requirement.  Meeting non-functional requirements is as necessary to the system as meeting functional requirements.
\bigskip

Let's return to the example and start sorting the stakeholder user stories into the four categories.  The stories will be highlighted using four colors with the following meaning:
\bigskip

\end{slshape}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \hilite{Cyan}{Untranslatable Stuff}
	\item \hilite{Goldenrod}{Interface Stuff}
	\item \hilite{Magenta}{Requirements Stuff}
	\item \hilite{Apricot}{Non-Functional Stuff}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{slshape}
\color{blue}
Beginning with the Course Instructor's Pedagogical Requirements.  The marked version is:
\end{slshape}
\bigskip

\begin{python}
TheFile = open('CourseInstructorHandsOn.tex')

lines = TheFile.readlines()

markedLines = [0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21]

hilite = ['Cyan','Cyan','Cyan','Magenta','Magenta','Magenta','Goldenrod','Magenta']

for everyline in markedLines:

    newstring = '\hilite{'+hilite[markedLines.index(everyline)]+'}{'+lines[everyline].rstrip('\n')+'}'

    print(newstring+'\n'+'\\bigskip'+'\n')

TheFile.close()
\end{python}

\begin{slshape}
\color{blue}

The Course Instructor's Pedagogical Requirements has one item classified as Interface Stuff dealing with the input impedance of the amplifier.  This item must be further sorted by the machine in Figure \ref{fig:InterfaceSorting}.  This machine determines if the item is a constraint or a requirement.

%\paragraph*{Design Constraints}
%
%Constraining a system design amounts to designing part of the system rather than simply specifying it.  Constraint is necessary 
%for a variety of reasons including but not limited to: reuse of previously designed systems, existing capital equipment,  standard interfaces, and known 
%environmental conditions.
%\bigskip
	%
%As a rule designers hate constraints.  Designers are a vain bunch.  They see themselves as being the best person for the job and see 
%constraints as affronts to their competence.  You will save yourself needing to explain a constraint to an affronted designer by 
%explaining the constraint clearly in the specification (really clearly).
%\bigskip
%
%The sorting categories include two types of constraints:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Interface Constraints
%\item Method Constraints
%\end{enumerate}
%
%{\bf{\underline{Interface Constraints}}} exist because the functioning system must interface with something else.  One type of interface is a digital interface such as universal serial bus (USB) and the best way to express this interface constraint is to point to a Referenced Document and say `follow this'.  Analog interfaces are specified with such things as input impedance and voltage/current levels.  Typically simple human/machine interfaces can be specified in an engineering document but if you have to specify a complex human/machine interface there are standards for this type of problem also.  See, for example, the Apple user interface `requirements' are found here (\href{https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/}{Apple User Experience Documentation}).  Again, why retype the wheel when you can just reference the wheel specification document.  Referenced documents really are your friend.
%\bigskip
%
%{\bf{\underline{Method Constraints}}} exist because a part of the system has been designed by the spec writer.  As an example a specific part number is stated in the specification and the designer is constrained to use this part to fulfill a requirement.  To reiterate \underline{explain your constraint} or be prepared to do a lot of explaining later.
%\bigskip
%
%\paragraph*{Requirements}
%
%I have divided the Requirements into Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.  In my view non-functional requirements are better understood as functional support requirements.

%\subsubsection{Amplifying Element Constraint}
%
%The controls lab power amplifier module shall use a commercially available power operational amplifier as it amplifying element.  This constraint is placed on the module design
%because of mechanical and electrical/computer engineering student familiarity with operational amplifiers.
%\bigskip
%

%\bigskip  
%
%It didn't take long to find the next one.
%
%\begin{quote}
	%\input{CourseInstructorSafety}
%\end{quote}
%
%This constraint is troublesome.  While the course instructor really doesn't want to shock students (a rare instructor indeed), the designer of this module has little control over the power supply voltages.  The responsibility for these voltages is likely fixed by available equipment.  The course instructor would have been better off stating that, due to available lab equipment, the power supply voltages are limited to a maximum of $\pm V$.  An even better constraint would set a range of acceptable voltages such as 12 to 18 volts. Let's write this constraint in that way.

%The control power operational amplifiers shall operate on power supplies with output voltages symmetric about a ground reference voltages $\lvert {V_{+}} \rvert = \lvert {V_{-}} \rvert = V$  with $V$ in the range of $10 \:\text{volts} \le V \le 18 \: \text{volts}$.  The power supply voltages of the power amplifier module are constrained to these value due to the availability of laboratory power supplies that operate in this range.

%Now is good time to discuss the difference between design constraints and requirements.  Why don't we treat the rail mounting constraint as a requirement?  We could and often we would by simply specifying an exact mounting structure for the power amplifier with no explanation of why it has to be the size and shape that it must be.  However, the rail mounting system is an external standard that we must follow and my experience tells me that informing the designer of the reason for this constraint keeps the designer happier.  And happier designers mean happier spec writers!
%\bigskip
%
%At this point we can simply state the fundamental constraint and leave the actual mounting envelope sizes to another place in the document (probably the Interface section) or we can state the complete requirement here.  I choose to put it here and back reference it in the requirements simply because it is a constraint and splitting the needed data into two places could lead to interpretation errors.  The rail mounting constraint follows.

%The module package dimension along the rail shall be no more six inches.

%
%We can now look for other constraints in the stakeholders' user stories.  The last course instructor user story uses indefinite words such as 'need', `can', and `recommended'.  These words imply latitude in implementation and as such will be expanded in the appropriate requirements section.

%
%The lab instructor user stories yield needs no specific constraints.  Remember even a specific requirement is not a constraint if no specific method is expressed.
%\bigskip
%
%The lab student user stories also have needs but without expressing specific methods.  No constraints here.
%\bigskip
%
%The USU ECE Department user stories have flirtations with constraints but never quite get there with phases such as `must be a simple' and 'should cost less'.  While the Department may be sincere about these requirements they are not constraining the designer to a specific method to achieve them (they aren't even really requiring them).

	%transients are defned here. Leakage (uid or current) is usually defined here.
	%Compatibility with fluids is often defined here. It is a good idea to start with a previous

%\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
%
%\begin{slshape} \color{blue}
%
%What follows is a really long (and yet strangely incomplete) list of potential non-functional requirements.  You will likely have noticed that the functional requirements for the controls lab power amplifier is a pretty short list.  Simple signals in and out and a frequency response requirement.  We should be able to stop this madness now and build the thing.  Sadly, we can't stop yet.
%\bigskip
%
%The device functions described in the section above don't and can't stand alone.  These functions require a lot of support from the environment.  To use a common example, the functions of a cell phone are simply dreams without the battery,  The functions of that same phone are useable only because of an effectively designed package.  Your cell phone is useful over a range of temperatures (a much smaller range than you are likely aware of (\href{https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201678}{iPhone Temperature Ranges})) because the designers made it useful over the range of temperatures that were specified.  In short, function is meaningless without a non-functional framework or, in other words, a functional support framework.
%\bigskip
%
%Our example is no different.  The amplifier must be supplied with power.  It must be able to operate over a range of temperatures and dissipate heat so as to keep the amplifying element safe.  It must be packaged to make it possible for us to actually use it.  We specify those requirements in this section and include the list of a bunch of others that may or may not apply to our specific project.
%\bigskip
%
%Returning to the user stories we look for the requirements that the users have provided that can be classified as non-functional requirements.  The first one we encounter deals with the electrical wiring and it seems reasonable then to group electrical support (non-functional) issues into their own section.  The course instructor requires:
