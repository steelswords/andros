\section{STAKEHOLDER REQUIREMENTS} % http://dilbert.com/strip/2006-01-29
\begin{slshape} \color{blue}
This section is fundamentally a list of characteristics and features requested by the stakeholders.  Stakeholders are anyone that has part in the system whether in designing it, packaging it, using it, maintaining it, etc.  Forgetting or ignoring a stakeholder often means change at a project phase when change is expensive.
\bigskip

As an example, you are tasked to design a large temperature display for a bank.  The typical `customer' only passively interacts with the device through its display therefore having no input to the system.  However, the designers and maintainers of 	the system must have the ability to modify the system and evaluate their modifications through the display.  These users access the system both through input and output and their needs must be met by the design.   
\bigskip

I have identified the stakeholders in the power amplifier module project listed and they are listed in the specification as follows.
\bigskip
\end{slshape}

The stakeholders for the USU ECE Controls Lab Power Amplifier Module are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The course instructor
	\item The lab instructor
	\item The lab student
	\item The USU ECE Department
\end{enumerate}


\begin{slshape}
\color{blue}

\StopSign  Think about the stakeholders in your project.  Write down a list of stakeholders in your project on your specifications template.  Think about your project as if it were to be produced commercially.  Think deeply.
\bigskip

\subsection*{Gathering Stakeholder Requirements}  
	
One approach to writing client requirements is to use what are called `user stories'.  User stories are essentially the information that a user (stakeholder) will give you when asked what the system must do for them.  See the following website	for more information on user stories:
\bigskip
	
(\href{https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories}{User Stories}).  
\bigskip  

Some users are more difficult to get stories out of than others as this Dilbert cartoon attests.
\bigskip

(\href{http://dilbert.com/strip/2006-01-29}{Alice Tries to Extract Requirements From a Stakeholder}).
\bigskip

Requirements answer the `what' questions about your project.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item What must it do?
	\item What must it weigh?  
	\item What environments must it endure?
	\item What must be done to ensure safety, maintainability, cost, etc.?
	\item What constrains the design (and designers)?
	\item + many other potential questions in many categories.
\end{itemize}

It is important that you don't try and complete the design at this step.    We don't design (specify the `how's) at this point for two primary reasons: we may be only specifying the project and then turning the requirements over to a designer or we don't want to pigeon-hole our thinking this early in the design process.  Keeping an open mind at this stage of the design often leads us to better thought-out designs.  You should marginally note your ideas of how to meet the requirement, but do not {\underline{require}} a specific `how' unless it is truly a design constraint.  Don't worry, there will be plenty of time to figure out how we are going to meet the requirements of the project a little later in the design process.
\bigskip

Requirements typically divide themselves into design constraints, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.  For example, a functional requirement would state that the device shall measure and record barometric pressure with such and such accuracy every minute over a 24 hour period.  A non-functional requirement would require that the device operates on no more than 500mW average power with power maximums of 1W.
\bigskip   

We see an example of a true design constraint in the WISE scientific instrument designed by the Space Dynamics Laboratory at Utah State University.  The systems designers required a specific FPGA instead of a designer chosen micro-processor simply because they knew that there wasn't any micro that would function in the expected space environment.

Continuing with the power amplifier module as an example the stakeholder user stories are:

As useful as user stories and user interviews are they are not perfect and your access to users may be incomplete.  It is up to you to fill in the missing spots.  Some of the areas that are typically missed include power requirements (batteries, wall power, hamsters, etc.), packaging size and weight requirements (standard packaging, wear on your wrist, tow in trailer, or my personal favorite: the portable data acquisition system at Boeing where portable meant you could move it with a fork lift), and operating environments (we live a desert and when we design we often forget humid operating environments).

Time to identify and then interview your stakeholders!  I like this step.  It is fun to hear how others who have an interest in this system view it.  There is a classic drawing about how different stakeholders see an airplane.  You can see the drawing here (\href{http://aviatormag.com.au/wp/intelligent-design/}{How the Stakeholders See the Same Airplane}). 
\bigskip

I realize that as a student you may not have access to all of the stakeholders for your project.  You may have to role play with your project partners or an available, yet naive, friend.  Pretend is fun, at least you used to like it.
