As a lab instructor I am tasked with overseeing and assisting six lab groups of three students concurrently.  Fragile systems that do not tolerate student mistakes
frustrate both myself and the students.

Since I am unable to observe all student groups at the same time and since the students will not, in general, 
wait for me to get them started I need a system that tolerates students mis-wiring.
