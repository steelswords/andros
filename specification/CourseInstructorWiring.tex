As a course instructor I have observed that mis-wiring is the most frequent cause of electronic failure in the lab.
\bigskip

The module must detect power supply mis-wiring where grounds and/or $V_{-}$ 	and $V_{+}$ are interchanged with ground or each other.
\bigskip

The module must be designed so that such wiring mistakes do not harm the module.
\bigskip

Additionally, the module needs to inform the user that it is miswired.
\bigskip


Additionally, the module must protect itself against amplifier output shorts to ground or other over-current conditions.
